I've recently become more interested in how much pollution the internet causes - I've known about this in general, but I've started learning to implement a few best practices in my work. Here are a few resources that have come in handy for me:

**[The Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/)**
A basic guide to the ethics of sustainable web development.

**[sustainable.dev](https://the-sustainable.dev/)**
Offers various techniques for different platforms to reduce your carbon imprint, like [Lazy loading â€“ without JavaScript](https://the-sustainable.dev/optimising-speed-by-lazy-loading-without-javascript/).

**[Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)**
Estimate your site's current carbon imprint.

**[The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)**
Search for green web hosting services by type.

**[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)**
How to assess website performance with Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools.

I'm still learning, but these are some good places to start!
