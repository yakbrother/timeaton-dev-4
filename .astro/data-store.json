Neither the code nore the tests were shown to me. I just had to make them work. I did, in the way I had been learning, and all tests passed. The response was “I don’t like your style.” I found that profoundly unhelpful, because I’m willing to adapt to new styles - but without knowing a single thing about the company it’s difficult to guess what they like. I asked for a second try, perhaps after talking with an engineer, but received no answer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another particularly annoying response I received two weeks ago was “We like your CV, but we need someone who knows Laravel and can work for less money.” I replied that my CV was full of my Laravel expertise and I’m willing to accept a lower salary to start. The response was just “We need someone who wants a smaller salary.” Oh well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One other problem, I think, is that most of my writing and programming is proprietary. All I have to show is my personal work, not my larger enterprise work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have always worked and hired people on the philosophy that if they were smart and fit in the team, it didn’t matter what their expertise was. “OK, so you can solve this with your preferred style or language? Well, we like you so we’ll teach you our style.” But that has not much been the case in my tries recently.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alas, I need to revise my strategy in some way to be more successful, much like a coal minor, “walking down those ole’ roads looking for a job”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it goes, until you meet the right person!\u003C/p>",{"headings":236,"localImagePaths":237,"remoteImagePaths":238,"frontmatter":239,"imagePaths":241},[],[],[],{"title":227,"author":15,"publicationDate":240,"slug":224,"public":19,"description":228,"category":97},["Date","2023-07-21T03:42:51.000Z"],[],"allonz-y-basic-typography",{"id":242,"data":244,"body":248,"filePath":249,"digest":250,"rendered":251},{"title":245,"slug":242,"author":15,"description":246,"category":17,"publicationDate":247,"public":19},"Allonz-Y - Basic CSS Typography","A few notes on starting my first UI framework.",["Date","2023-05-14T03:42:51.000Z"],"Part of me appreciates Tailwind CSS.
