For this reason I keep ending up coding “the hard way”. I like writing my own HTML, CSS, and Javascript, not using libraries or frameworks - and I like using Vim or Sublime Text (or Windows Notebook in the old days) instead of an IDE. I’m not a purist by any means - I just love a beautiful HTML document. There’s something deeply satisfying about crafting clean, efficient code that works exactly as intended, without any extra layers.</p>\n<p>Beyond coding, both music and travel shape my life. I love making friends across cultures and learning their stories, especially when it involves playing my mandolin or ukulele around a campfire with new friends. This love of different perspectives eventually led me to Switzerland, where I now live with my brilliant wife - and two cats (whose evil-to-cuteness ratio fluctuates dramatically from moment to moment).</p>\n<p>I’m always open to chat with other programmers, designers, and musicians. If you happen to live in the Nyon/Lausanne area, and would like to meet up, I’d be happy to make a new friend!
